As a Learning Resources Intern on the MIT Media Lab's Scratch team, I helped develop, design, and implement these Scratch Coding Cards.
They include step-by-step instructions for both students learning Scratch and educators seeking to use Scratch as a classroom learning resource.

You can find an online version of the cards here: https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/cards/en/scratch-cards-all.pdf.
